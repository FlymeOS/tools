    <item name="NO_CONFLICT" code="31">
		<solution>
		  Advice:
		    1. Although no conflict, mistakes still come out sometimes,
		       it depends on your device, VENDOR may change AOSP a lot.

		    2. Fall through to fullota, flash the outcome into your device,
		       and then fix bugs depends on real-time logs.

	<item name="CONFLICTS_HAPPENED" code="32">
		<solution>
		  Advice:
		    1. Each conflict is marked out like:

		      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; VENDOR
		        Codes of VENDOR
		      =======
		        Codes of BOSP
		      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BOSP

		      you'd better resolve all conflicts before going on with the following work.

		    2. You might follow three steps to resolve conflicts manually:

		       - compare VENDOR and REJECT to find out where conflicts happened;
		       - compare AOSP   and BOSP   to find out why conflicts happened;
		       - resolve conflicts in VENDOR.
